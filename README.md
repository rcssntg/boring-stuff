# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Study Notes

Welcome to my study notes repository for the book *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*.

## Purpose

I created this repository to document and organize my notes as I progress through the book. It's a space where I can:

- **Practice**: Reinforce what I've learned by writing down key concepts, coding exercises, and personal insights.
- **Git Skills**: Hone my Git skills by regularly committing and pushing updates to this repository.

Feel free to explore the content, and if you're also studying this book, I hope you find these notes helpful!
